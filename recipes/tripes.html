    <h3>A well prepared tripes delicacy </h3>
    <p> Matumbo, AKA tripe has always been one of my favorite proteins. Growing up, Iâ€™d always look forward to Matumbo-ugali nights.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Matumbo is a common meal among Kenyans. Served both at home and at various vibandaski (local spots) and restaurants.Matumbo in English is known as tripe, a name known to very few.</p>
    <p>It is the edible stomach lining/ intestines of farm animals especially cows.</p>
    <p> The meat is not only affordable but an excellent source of protein, a good source of zinc and phosphorous.It's best enjoyed with ugali, mukimo or chapati and a side of greens.</p>
